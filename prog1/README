NOTES:
------------------------------------------
The List ADT contains the following files:
README      This documentation file.
List.h      The header file describing the ADT operations.
List.c	    The implementation of the List ADT.
Listdr.c    A simple program that tests out the ADT operations.
            This program reads input from stdin and assumes that the user knows how to
            enter the data correctly. Error messages are written to stdout.
store.c     The user's implementation of the module 'List'. Similiar to the driver program,
            but it reads data from one or more files -- not stdin -- and handles errors apporiately
            by writing to stderr.
Makefile    A makefile that complies the module, driver, and user program;
	    (1) it makes these object files List.o Listdr.o and an executionable testList.
	    (2) it makes these object files List.o store.o and an executionable userList.
            NOTE: make or gmake all compiles and links the object files into the executionables
